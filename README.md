# meteograph
A Python script to fetch weather forecast from the Meteorologisk institutt (Norway) and show it in an interactive plot.

### Dependencies
+ Python 3
+ Plotly (offline)
+ Beautiful Soup 4

### Usage
+ Run the script from the command line and provide an address as a positional argument. Whatever Google Maps can resolve is okay.
+ If you wish to use coordinates instead, use `-c` and separate latitude and longitude with a space. Use decimal points.
+ The forecast will open in your browser as a html file.
